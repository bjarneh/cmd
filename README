[ What ]

Small command line utilities:

    * wcl  -  recursive `wc -l`
    * nog  -  guess if (Norwegian) files are Latin-1 or UTF-8 (very basic)



[ Install ]

Compile the makefile:

    8g _gdmk.go         [6g/5g pending architecture]
    8l -o gdmk _gdmk.8  [6l/5l pending architecture]

or:
    gccgo -o gdmk _gdmk.go

Use the 'install' target

    ./gdmk install

to remove/uninstall:

    ./gdmk uninstall


The install target will compile the binaries and
move them to $HOME/bin with fallback to $GOBIN
